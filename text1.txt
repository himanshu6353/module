Java was created by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems in 1991, originally named "Oak." It was publicly released in 1995 as a platform-independent programming language. Over the years, Java has evolved with significant updates, and it remains one of the most widely used languages for web, mobile, and enterprise applications.



Here are the key features of Java in short:

1. **Platform Independence**: Write once, run anywhereâ€”Java programs can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
2. **Object-Oriented**: Supports concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
3. **Simple and Easy to Learn**: Java syntax is clear and resembles C++, making it easier for developers to learn.
4. **Multithreading**: Supports simultaneous execution of multiple threads, making applications more efficient.
5. **Security**: Built-in security features like bytecode verification and the sandbox model to protect against malicious code.
6. **Robust**: Strong memory management, exception handling, and garbage collection.
7. **Distributed Computing**: Facilitates network-based applications, like client-server systems, using libraries like RMI (Remote Method Invocation).
8. **Rich API**: Provides a comprehensive set of libraries for I/O, networking, data structures, and more.
